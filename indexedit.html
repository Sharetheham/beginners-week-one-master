<<p>I am currently learning to code with Code First Girls. Going over everything from how the
internet works, to creating websites and version control with git. A lot to cover in only 8 weeks!
Everyone should learn to code, here are some pretty good reasons why...</p>
<ol>
HTML is cool
<li>CSS is cooler</li>
<li>JSS is best </li>
</ol>

What do you need to create a website?<i>

Not much!
<ul>A computer (always a good start)
<ul>A text editor (I am using atom)
<ul>Some HTML, CSS and JS files

Follow my progress on github
